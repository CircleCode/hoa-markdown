# Paused project

This project was an attemps to write a markdown parser by using
[Hoa](http://hoa-project.net)'s' compiler.

After some tests, and discussions with @Hywan, it seems parsing markdown is
really tricky, and seems obviously complicated with an llk parser, where
a peg parser would probably be more appropriate (see excellent @jgm work with
jgm/peg-markdown).

Maybe I'll come back later to this project, maybe notâ€¦
